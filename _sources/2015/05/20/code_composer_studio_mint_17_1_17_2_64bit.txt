code composer studio mint 17.1, 17.2 64bit
==========================================

Code composer studio can be downloaded directly from ti.
When u extract the zipped file u will get a readme and a *.bin file which u have to make executable.

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo chmod +x ./*.bin #with a terminal session in the extracted folder
    
Once the file is executable u can run:

.. code-block:: shell
    
    ./filename.bin
    
, or double click one the binary. 

Usually the installer should complain about missing libraries. To obtain these u can simply type

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt-get install libgnomevfs2-0:i386 liborbit-2.0:i386 libusb-0.1:i386
    
So after installing the drivers and code composer studio itself the linux drivers are still  missing.
The driver installation has to be performed via terminal so u have to navigate to the ti folder u specified in the installation and execute the driver installation as root.

.. code-block:: shell

    cd /home/username/ti/ccsv6/install_scripts
    sudo ./install_drivers.sh

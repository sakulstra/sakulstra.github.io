pi ssh slow
===========
In recent days I connected a rs485 chip to the raspberry pi and programmed it via biicode and ssh(tutorial will follow).
The great advantage with biicode is, that u don't have to set up cross-compiling and stuff like than on your self because biicode manages this with some simple `commands`_.
Another important advantage is, that u can easily use the wiringpi library with a simple #include.

The problem was, that I had huge delay problems with rpi:send and spi:ssh (also with the usual ssh).
The ssh connection was freakin slow and it needed seconds till the "enter password" prompt showed up.

A simple solution for this problem is, to edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the raspberry-pi. Add the line:

.. code-block:: shell
	
	UseDNS no

and everything should work as expected.

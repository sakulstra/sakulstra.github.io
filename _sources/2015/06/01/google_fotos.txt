google fotos face search
========================

Googles new fotos app seems to be pretty awesome, but if you are looking for the "find by person/face" tab like shown in the preview u'll recognice that there is no person field in your listing.

This is most likely caused by country legislations:
Face search is only allowed in a few countrys - in germany for example you wount be able to search for persons.

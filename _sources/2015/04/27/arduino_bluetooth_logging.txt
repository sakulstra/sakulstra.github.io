arduino bluetooth logging
=========================
In recent days I worked on a android graph tool called `BlueGraph`_ which allows to monitor real time data of sensors.
Therefore I used a ZS-040 sending data from an msp430 with a baud rate of 9600.
The mobile phone receives this data and displays a nice graph containing the data ;)

The app expects the data to be in the following format:

.. code-block:: shell
	
	(+|-)(d*)(delimiter)(+|-)(d*)...(\n)

Features
^^^^^^^^
- plotting up to x graphs simultaneously
- change the window Size
- auto scale/static scale for y-axis
- configure the delimiter between the data entries 

Till now the feature list is pretty sparse - if u have some ideas please let me know in the comments.

Regards,
Lukas
